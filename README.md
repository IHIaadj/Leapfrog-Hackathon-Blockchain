# Leapfrog-Hackathon-Blockchain
# Introduction
In Algeria, managing goods by the government is a manual repetitive and wasting time task. Without mentionning the frauds and falscifications that are generated because of the latency and the paper-based database. In this hackathon, with a subject of "Smart cities", we decided to improve this aspect by using the blockchain technology to digitalize the data and have a trusty and real-time access.
